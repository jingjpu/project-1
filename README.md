# crypto_realestate_v2
A first step towards Crypto enabled Settlements

## Executive Summary

An Early Stage Online Marketplace for New Homes* has buyers who wish to transact in crypto and sellers who wish to settle in USD
New Homes are distinct use case because there is presently no efficient way to hedge (insure) crypto denominated contracts 10-18 months.
Company is current leader in new home Marketplace and would to maintain edge for home purchases using Crypto.

First step and project goal is to convert all homes prices from USD to BTC/ETC and explore what it might cost to transact using Crypto.

### Data Collection and Cleanup

House Price obtained from company API and currency info from FTX.  (FTX is industry leader in crypto derivatives.)
Home Price Data Obtained from company mySQL dump - cleanup process included removing data privacy concerns, locating relevant tables, and requesting additional information from company on the data schema and relationships.

### Running the Analyzer

Install a new conda environment for this project. We will be using `python 3.7.11` for this repository.

```bash
conda create -n dev_crypto_realestate python=3.7.11 anaconda
```

Activate the newly created environment and verify the python version.

```bash
conda activate dev_crypto_realestate
python --version
```

Install and add the ipykernel environment to your jupyter notebook.

```bash
conda install -c anaconda ipykernel
python -m ipykernel install --user --name=dev_etf

```

Install the required python packages.

```bash
conda install hvplot, streamz, holoviews
conda install -c conda-forge streamz
conda install -c conda-forge holoviews
conda install hvplot
conda install -c conda-forge pyviz
conda install -c conda-forge python-dotenv
conda install -c pyviz panel
conda install -c pyviz geoviews
```

Clone the remote repository to your local developer environment and `cd` into the folder.
```bash
git clone git@github.com:msashokkumar/crypto_realestate_v2.git
cd crypto_realestate_v2
```

Start the jupyter lab server from the terminal as follows:

```bash
jupyter lab
```

Open and execute the file `crypto_realestate_v2.ipynb`


This crypto realester tool uses an `.env` file to store FTX API key and secret keys. To use this tool, create and login to [FTX US exchange](https://ftx.us/profile) to access your trading API keys. Then create an `.env` file to your remote repository on your local environment with the following syntex below:
```
ftx_api_key=<your_api_key>
ftx_secret_key=<your_secret_key>
```
